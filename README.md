To complete the **24-Hour Healthcare Scheduler Exam**, hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps and milestones for you:

- admin password 123
- can click to time in order to check the appointment

### Step 0: Installation

- npm i
- npm run dev

### Step 1: Core Objective Completion

- The goal is to deliver a functional backend system for scheduling healthcare appointments with a focus on API development and core backend functionality.

### Step 2: Tech Stack Decision

- **Next.js 14+**: The core framework for both backend (API Routes) and frontend (if time permits).
- **MongoDB (NoSQL)**: Chosen for the database due to its flexibility in handling healthcare provider and appointment data.
- **REST API**: Preferred over GraphQL for simplicity and speed of development.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and helps avoid runtime errors.
- **Shadcn UI**: Used for consistent UI components, though optional based on time availability.

### Step 3: Anonymous User Features

- **View Providers**: API to list healthcare providers and available appointment times.
- **Reserve Appointment**: API to book appointments without login, providing a unique reservation code for each booking.
- **Text-Based or MongoDB Storage**: Backend stores user and appointment data.

### Step 4: Future Extensions

- **User Registration and Login**: Expand the system to handle account creation, appointment history, and management (reschedule, cancel).
- **UI Enhancements**: Build a more interactive, user-friendly UI using Shadcn UI components.
- **Deployment on Vercel**: Allow users to access and book appointments easily through a hosted solution.
- **Security**: Add authentication, encryption of sensitive data, and input validation.

Focus first on the **anonymous user flow**, completing the backend APIs, and then plan out additional features like UI enhancements and deployment for future extension.
